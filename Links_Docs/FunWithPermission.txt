 Here's a list of some common settings, numerical values and their meanings:

    -rw------- (600) -- Only the user has read and write permissions.

    -rw-r--r-- (644) -- Only user has read and write permissions; the group and others can read only.

    -rwx------ (700) -- Only the user has read, write and execute permissions.

    -rwxr-xr-x (755) -- The user has read, write and execute permissions; the group and others can only read and execute.

    -rwx--x--x (711) -- The user has read, write and execute permissions; the group and others can only execute.

    -rw-rw-rw- (666) -- Everyone can read and write to the file. Bad idea.

    -rwxrwxrwx (777) -- Everyone can read, write and execute. Another bad idea. 

Here are a couple common settings for directories:

    drwx------ (700) -- Only the user can read, write in this directory.

    drwxr-xr-x (755) -- Everyone can read the directory, but its contents can only be changed by the user.
