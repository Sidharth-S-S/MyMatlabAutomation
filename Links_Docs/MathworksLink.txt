Beginning with R2020a, you can export your Simulink model as a standalone FMU with Simulink Compiler . When a third-party tool runs the FMU, no MATLAB or Simulink license will be required. 
Beginning with R2019a, the ability to export a Simulink model to a tool-coupling FMU is available in Simulink:

Wrap your Simulink model and project files into an FMU that has a co-simulation interface. When a third-party tool runs the FMU, the FMU checks out the required MathWorks® licenses, starts a local MATLAB® session, and runs the model.
In R2018b, a MathWorks®-provided support package: "Tool-Coupling Co-Simulation FMU Export for Simulink support package" is required
While we recommend this to be downloaded through the Add-On Explorer, a link to open it in Add-On Explorer is available on File Exchange:

For R2018a and prior, there are third-party products which may provide this functionality. Please refer to the following links for more information:

Found a solution by pure coincidence!
After the co-simulation is completed, running the following command returns a list of run identifiers:
runIDs = Simulink.sdi.getAllRunIDs
last element of this vector refers to your co-simulation. To retrieve the dataset object containing all logged signals in the model, use the following command:
cosim_id = runIDs(end);
dataset = Simulink.sdi.exportRun(cosim_id)
There you have it.
